## APPTAINER - INSTALLATION STEPS

## note
# SingularityCE was rebranded by the community as Apptainer. 
# Commands are the same (apptainer is the binary, sometimes singularity on older systems). 
# I’ll use apptainer below; if your system only has singularity, just swap the command name.

# dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libseccomp-dev pkg-config uidmap squashfs-tools \
    cryptsetup-bin golang-go git wget

# install from Apptainer deb (replace version to latest if needed)
VER=1.3.5
wget https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/download/v${VER}/apptainer_${VER}_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i apptainer_${VER}_amd64.deb
